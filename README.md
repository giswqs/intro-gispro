## How to Run Code Examples

The code examples can be run using Docker. There are two Docker images available:

A lightweight docker image without Apache Sedona:

```bash
docker pull giswqs/pygis:book
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/app/workspace giswqs/pygis:book
```

A docker image with Apache Sedona:

```bash
docker pull giswqs/pygis:sedona
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/app/workspace giswqs/pygis:sedona
```
